## About this project

This webapp was developed as part of my Honours Project on the Web Design and Development course at Edinburgh Napier University. 

Beacon is a social network website designed with the intention of being easy to use for people who may not be experienced in the use of digital technology, such as older generations who did not grow up using it. The overall aim of the website is to positively affect the lives of its users by allowing them to stay connected with family and loved ones by making the website accessible and easy to use.
